**Libft**

The **libft** project, short for "library functions," is an essential first step in building a foundational C library, packed with crucial functions that simplify development and optimize code efficiency. This repository offers developers a powerful set of custom C functions, each crafted to replace or extend the basic functionalities commonly needed across projects.

### Key Features

- **Standard Library Re-creations**: Reinvents fundamental C library functions, like `strlen`, `strcpy`, and `strcmp`. By reconstructing these, developers gain a deeper insight into their operations and can easily adjust them to fit specific project requirements.

- **Extended Utilities**: Beyond the standard library, libft includes various utility functions, essential data structures, and algorithms that support a wide range of programming tasks, offering a toolkit for more complex challenges.

- **Reliability and Testing**: Each function in libft has undergone rigorous testing to guarantee accuracy and performance across diverse scenarios, including various edge cases, making it a reliable addition to any project.

- **Simple Integration**: With consistent naming conventions and straightforward function signatures, libft is designed to integrate smoothly into larger projects.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The libraryâ€™s code is crafted to ensure it works seamlessly across different operating systems and compilers, making it versatile for various development environments.

### Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vanichx/Libft.git libft
   ```

2. **Compile the library**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. **Include headers in your source files**:
   ```c
   #include "libft.h"
   ```

By using libft, developers can sharpen their understanding of essential C concepts while building a powerful resource for future projects.
